To do in-place substitution it is quite tempting to do something like sed s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/ input.txt > input.txt . However this is a bad idea, why? Is this particular to sed? Use man sed to find out how to accomplish this.

Answer: Bash processes the redirects (>) first, so, by th etime the sed command is executed, the file is empty, making the regex substitution not possible.

to solve this issue, one can use the -i option.
	sed -E -i 's/REGEX?SUBSTITUTION/ input.txt'
This option writes the output to a temporary file, then rename it to the original file name.
